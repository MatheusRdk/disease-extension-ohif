# disease-button-extension
## Description
In this project, i created a test extension that adds disease severity level buttons to the left panel of the OHIF basic viewer. These buttons are intended to be stored as a medical observation in the study attributes in DCM4CHEE, assuming it is used as a DICOMWeb server.
